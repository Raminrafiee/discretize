Mesh Generation
===============

`discretize` provides a numerical grid (or "mesh") on which to solve differential
equations. Each mesh type has a similar API to make working with
different meshes relatively simple. Within `discretize`, all meshes are
classes that have properties like the number of cells `nC`, and methods,
like `plotGrid`.

To learn how to create meshes with `discretize`, we have provided a set
of tutorials. Click any image below to start the corresponding tutorial.
