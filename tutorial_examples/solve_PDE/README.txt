Solving PDEs
============


To solve a PDE numerically we must complete the following steps:

	1. Formulate the problem; e.g. the PDE and its boundary conditions
	2. Re-formulate the problem according to the weak formulation
	3. Decide where variable quantities should live; e.g. edges, faces, cell centers and nodes
	4. Formulate the discretized problem according to the finite volume method
	5. Compute the solve
